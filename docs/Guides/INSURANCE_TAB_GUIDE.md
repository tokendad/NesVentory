# Insurance Tab Feature Guide

## Overview

The Insurance Tab is a comprehensive feature added to NesVentory that allows you to manage insurance documentation for your primary locations (homes). This feature was introduced in PR #419 and is available in version 6.3.0 and later.

**IMPORTANT:** The Insurance tab is **only available for locations marked as "Primary Location (Home)"**.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Navigate to the Locations page** in NesVentory

2. **Identify or Create a Primary Location:**
   - Look for location cards with a "HOME" badge - these are primary locations
   - If you don't have any primary locations yet:
     - Click the "Add Location" button
     - Fill in the location details
     - **Check the "Primary Location (Home)" checkbox** ✓
     - Complete and save the location

3. **Open Location Settings:**
   - On the location card for your primary location, click the **⚙️ Settings** button
   - This opens the Location Details Modal

4. **Access the Insurance Tab:**
   - In the modal, you'll see two tabs at the top:
     - 📝 Details
     - 🏠 Insurance
   - Click the **🏠 Insurance** tab to access insurance features

#### Insurance Company Information

- **Total Value:** Property purchase price + sum of all item purchase prices
- **Estimated Value:** Property estimated value + sum of all item estimated values

### Print & Export Options

The Insurance tab provides three export options:

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Insurance tab"

This is the most common issue. Check the following:

1. **Verify the location is marked as Primary:**
   - Open the location's Settings (⚙️ button)
   - Go to the Details tab
   - Ensure "Primary Location (Home)" checkbox is checked ✓
   - Save changes

2. **Check for the HOME badge:**
   - Primary locations display a "HOME" badge on their location card
   - If you don't see this badge, the location is not marked as primary

3. **Create a new primary location:**
   - If you're using seed/demo data from before version 6.3.0, it may not have any primary locations
   - Create a new location and mark it as primary, or
   - Edit an existing location to mark it as primary

### "The Settings button doesn't appear"

The Settings button (⚙️) should appear on all location cards. If it doesn't:
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache
- Check that you're using version 6.3.0 or later
