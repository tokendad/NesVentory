# Copilot commit message instructions (MANDATORY)

All generated commit messages MUST follow Conventional Commits:

  <type>(optional-scope): short-description

Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci

Rules (MANDATORY)
- The subject line MUST start with one of the allowed types followed by `:` or `(scope):`.
  Examples: `feat(ui): add item details modal`, `fix(api): handle missing user`.
- Subject line MUST be <= 50 characters and NOT end with a period.
- Use imperative present tense (e.g. "add", not "added").
- If more context is needed, leave a blank line and add a body wrapped at ~72 chars.
- If referencing an issue, use `#123` in the body or footer.

Exact template for automation / bots
- If this commit is an autogenerated "initial plan" or scaffolding commit from an assistant or bot, the commit subject MUST be exactly:
  `chore: add initial plan`
  (lowercase `chore:` prefix, spelled "initial" correctly).

Examples (valid)
- `feat(auth): add JWT validation`
- `fix(api): handle missing user`
- `docs(readme): add screenshots for login and dashboard`
- `chore: add initial plan`

Special note for bots and agents (MANDATORY)
- Automation that creates commits or PRs MUST follow the "Exact template for automation / bots" above for initial plan commits. If the automation cannot produce a valid Conventional Commit, do not create the commit/PR — instead open a draft or add a comment with the proposed changes.

If you want stricter enforcement, pair this file with CI checks that block or fix invalid messages.
