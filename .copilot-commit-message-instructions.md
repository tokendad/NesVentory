# Copilot commit message instructions

Follow Conventional Commits: type(scope?): short-description

Rules
- Use one of these types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci
- Include a scope when relevant: e.g. `feat(auth): ...` or `fix(api): ...`
- Use imperative mood and present tense (e.g. "add" not "added")
- Keep the subject line <= 50 characters
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- If more context needed, leave a blank line then add a body wrapped at ~72 chars
- If referencing an issue, use `#123` in the body or footer
- If this is an autogenerated "initial plan" commit from an assistant, use `chore:` or `docs:` depending on intent

Examples
- feat(ui): add item details modal
- fix(api): handle missing user in response
- docs(readme): add screenshots for login and dashboard
- chore: initial plan for automation tasks

Special note for bots and Copilot agents
- If you are creating a "plan" or scaffolding-only commit, prefer:
  - `chore: add initial plan`  (if infra/maint)
  - `docs: add initial plan`  (if documentation)
- Always include the type prefix. If unsure, use `chore:` rather than no prefix.

If you want stricter enforcement, pair this file with your existing commitlint workflow (already present) so CI will fail PRs with non-conforming messages.
